        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Akheituame Ehis Jacob" width="500">
        <p>Hello! My name is Akheituame Ehis and I am from Edo, Nigeria. I enjoy eating rice and chicken which is my favorite. I am an enthusiastic and dedicated person who enjoys being part of a successful and productive team.
          My key strength is my ability to remain devoted to a project from initiation through to completion.
          
          I am quick to grasp new ideas and concepts, and to develop innovative and creative solutions to
          problems. I am able to work well on my own initiative and can demonstrate the highest levels of
          motivation and organization required to meet tight deadlines.
           </p>
